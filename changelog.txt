Changelog
1.0.2
	fixed not properly assigning null texture replacement
	print nice error message if some hashing goes wrong
	use of re-UV function (untiling) for miniatlas before applying world atlas for game mode TES5
	keep decal shader flag from nif for game mode TES5 - set UseDecalFlag=true in export file

1.0.1	added support for --logfile "c:\..." command line switch, defaults to current dir \ LODGen_log.txt if not set or error

1.0	added support for dds in export file, it will be used to create 2 flat surfaces for tree LOD
		uses FlatTextures= for x-width, y-height, z-shift, scale, lighting effect 1, path to normals file
	added support for AltTextures= replacement texture list (list of 3D names and textures), applied before atlas
	added support reading FO4 LOD nif and BGSM (BGSM always trumps data in nif)
	added BA2 support, GNRL only
	added export Mode=FO4, see updates to LODGen.pas for new export fields for SCOL data, enable parent form id, replacement textures, etc
	added export Mode=Merge5 to combine several nif into one
	added export Mode=convert4 (tes4) and Mode=convert5 (tes5) to atlas the UV of meshes, see convert.txt, miniatlas.txt in bin/Release
	read more block types typically used for trees to convert to statics

0.9	added material 'PassThru' - works for BSLightingShaderProperty and BSEffectShaderProperty
		entire shader will be copied straight into the bto
		shapes with equal shaders are merged
		textures will not be atlassed
		changes all vertex alpha to 1f, since LOD only has alpha on/off at 50%, vertex alpha is applied if SLSF2_LOD_Objects/SLSF2_HD_LOD_Objects are not set
		Extra Data List and Controllers are ignored
		keep vertex colors regardless of --dontGenerateVertexColors
	added alternate texture replacement - see LODGen_alt_tamriel.txt / LODGen_alt_textures_tamriel.txt in bin/Release
		applied before atlas
		Get 3D Index and 3D Name and replacement textures from CK - both 3D Index and 3D Name need to match in nif
		if source texture has \lod in path the desination must have it too and vice versa
	generate normals in case they are missing from a shape
	read tangents/bitangents from binary extra data, Oblivion

0.8	rewritten remove unseen faces code to be more effetive
	changed IgnoreTranslation= to be a mesh mask, e.g. to ignore all use just use .nif
	added NotHDMeshMask= requires UseHDFlag=true, matching meshes are not HD, overwrites flag from derived from column #2, overwritten by texture masks
	added IsHDMeshMask= requires UseHDFlag=true, matching meshes are HD, overwrites NotHDMeshMask, overwritten by texture masks

0.7	append to log file instead of overwriting
	added FO3 mode, same as FNV
	added FNV mode
	added BSShaderPPLightingProperty
	updated nitristrips
	fixed points to triangles conversion
	added NotHDTextureMask= matching textures are not HD, overwrites flag from derived from column #2
        added IsHDTextureMask= matching textures are HD, overwrites any other method
	new export file switches [default value]:
		GameMode=[TES5]/FNV
		DontMergeShapes=true/[false]
		DontGenerateVertexColors=true/[false]
		RemoveUnseenFaces=true/[false]
		IgnoreWater=true/[false] [FNV no effect]
		IgnoreMaterial=true/[false]
		DontFixTangents=true/[false]
		DontGenerateTangents=true/[false]
		UseHDFlag=[true]/false [FNV no effect] (0x00020000 in column #2)
		GlobalScale=[1.0]

0.6	fixed cell origin of LOD objects causing some LOD models to show/not show
	fixed use of world offset so filenames for reading BTR and writing BTO match
	fixed tangents and bitangents not being adjusted for LOD object rotation
	optimized remove unseen faces to also remove unseen vertices, vertex colors, normal, tangents and bitangents data for smaller file size
	remove HD flag and vertex color in LOD level 8/16 to match CK
	added support for additional material shaders Snow/Ash
	added support for SLSF2_Double_Sided flag
	lessened log output, added --verbose command line parameter to show all log messages
	added console error message for missing input file or data directory
	added stop error message for missing LOD nif 
	added stop error message if logfile cant be written to
	added verbose error message for missing landscape BTR, continues without removing unseen faces for quad
	added uv remapping for atlas textures
	added tolerance value for uv remapping
	added BSA archive reading for LOD meshes and landscape BTR, so no need to unpack them first
        atlas texture or 'lod' in texture name HD will be unset. All other textures set HD. --useHDLOD to use HD flag (2nd column) from input file to set HD on non atlassed textures with 'lod' in name
	moved a cmd line directory arguments to input file
	updated input file format to accept parameters in the form of parameter=value
	added IgnoreTranslation as a workaround for certain problematic vanilla meshes
	read input file with current codepage
0.5	Last release by Ehamloptiran
