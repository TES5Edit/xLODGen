0.6	fixed cell origin of LOD objects causing some LOD models to show/not show
	fixed use of world offset so filenames for reading BTR and writing BTO match
	fixed tangents and bitangents not being adjusted for LOD object rotation
	optimized remove unseen faces to also remove unseen vertices, vertex colors, normal, tangents and bitangents data for smaller file size
	remove HD flag and vertex color in LOD level 8/16 to match CK
	added support for additional material shaders Snow/Ash
	added support for SLSF2_Double_Sided flag
	lessened log output, added --verbose command line parameter to show all log messages
	added console error message for missing input file or data directory
	added stop error message for missing LOD nif 
	added stop error message if logfile cant be written to
	added verbose error message for missing landscape BTR, continues without removing unseen faces for quad
	added uv remapping for atlas textures
	added tolerance value for uv remapping
	added BSA archive reading for LOD meshes and landscape BTR, so no need to unpack them first
        atlas texture or 'lod' in texture name HD will be unset. All other textures set HD. --useHDLOD to use HD flag (2nd column) from input file to set HD on non atlassed textures with 'lod' in name
	moved a cmd line directory arguments to input file
	updated input file format to accept parameters in the form of parameter=value
	added IgnoreTranslation as a workaround for certain problematic vanilla meshes
	read input file with current codepage
0.5	Last release by Ehamloptiran
